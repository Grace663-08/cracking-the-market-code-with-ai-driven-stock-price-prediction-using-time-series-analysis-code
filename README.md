Steps to Build  AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Code:
Data Collection:

Use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to fetch stock price data.
Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, normalize or scale data, and create time series windows.
Feature Engineering:

Extract features like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), or MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
Model Selection:

Use AI models suitable for time series forecasting, such as:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
Transformer-based models
Evaluation:

Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared for evaluation.
Deployment:

Package the model into an API using Flask/FastAPI or deploy it on cloud platforms.
